This a repository housing the solution for 2024 Tik-Tok Tech Jam, on "Prevanting hate speech"

### Challenge 

 The internet has connected people through platforms that enable information
  exchange. To prevent hate and offensive speech, most platforms have
    community guidelines, moderation teams, and monitoring techniques. TikTok,
    for example, classifies content as restrictible (inappropriate for youth) or
    removable (violating policies). </br> </br> 
Our goal is to create an AI-powered solution
    that effectively classifies content as normal, offensive, or hate speech. A
    key challenge is accurately identifying and categorizing text per TikTok's
    hate speech policy. The complexity of natural language, including sarcasm,
    slang, and cultural references, complicates this task.
