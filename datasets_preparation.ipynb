The HRC report makes it clear that they don't know the motive in most of these cases, and complains that too few cases are reported as \"bias-motivated\" crime.\\n\\n\"As far as the man killed in Vermont just a few days ago authorities have yet to determine if his transgender status was a factor. They havenâ€™t expressly said anything except that they were still investigating.\"\\n\\nActually, as the article I posted said:\\n\\n\"Police initially investigated whether the murder was related to Beede's gender identity.
